## 📢 Contribution

My name is Matthew Felske --but most call me Mateo-- and I am part of the executive board for SHPE @ UWM as a webmaster. All descriptive content and media wouldn't be possible without my fellow board members who you can find on the site.

Please feel free to open issues or pull requests with ideas, improvements, or questions. Additionally, I've added a discussions tab to just communicate with me directly. Constructive criticism is the best way to get feedback and resolve problems!
