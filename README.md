# SHPE UWM Website

Welcome to the official repository for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) chapter!
This website is built to empower Hispanic STEM leaders in our community, share events, programs, and foster connection among students and professionals.

## 🚧 Early Development Notice

> **Please Note:** This site is in its very early development stages.
> The deployed version on GitHub Pages is a static export, so some images and visual elements may not appear correctly.
> I'll link in the official website deployment link once the site reaches its final stages.
> I'm actively working w/ the board members to improve the experience—stay tuned for updates!
> **ADDITIONAL NOTE:** NOT SUITED FOR MOBILE DEVICES YET

## 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools

- **Next.js**: Modern React-based framework for fast, scalable sites ([Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs))
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development ([Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com))
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for safer, scalable code
- **Radix UI, Lucide, Framer Motion, SWR, Zod, Zustand**: Powerful component libraries and utilities for forms, icons, animation, state management, and schema validation
- **Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights**: Performance monitoring and analytics
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages (see `.github/workflows/`)

See [`package.json`](https://github.com/felskeM/shpe-uwm/blob/main/package.json) for the full list of dependencies.

## 📦 Deployment

- The site is deployed as a **static export** to [GitHub Pages](https://felskem.github.io/shpe-uwm/).
- Static export means some dynamic features (like image optimization, size configuration, and links) may not work as expected.
- See the [GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/felskeM/shpe-uwm/tree/main/.github/workflows) for deployment details.

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development For Dynamic Site

### To run the site locally so you can see all the features the current github.io site isn't showing:

Clone the repository and install npmjs:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ✨ Design Highlights

- Accessible, responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS
- Modern, minimal style guide (see `/style-guide`)
- Focus on real text, contrast, and UX polish

## 📢 Contribution

My name is Matthew Felske --but most call me Mateo-- and I am part of the executive board for SHPE @ UWM as a webmaster. All descriptive content and media wouldn't be possible without my fellow board members who you can find on the site.

Please feel free to open issues or pull requests with ideas, improvements, or questions. Additionally, I've added a discussions tab to just communicate with me directly. Constructive criticism is the best way to get feedback and resolve problems!
