# SHPE UWM Website

Welcome to the official repository for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) chapter!  
This website is built to empower Hispanic STEM leaders in our community, share events, programs, and foster connection among students and professionals.

## 🚧 Early Development Notice

> **Note:** This site is in its very early development stages.  
> The deployed version on GitHub Pages is a static export, so some images and visual elements may not appear correctly.  
> We're actively working to improve the experience—stay tuned for updates!

## 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools

- **Next.js**: Modern React-based framework for fast, scalable sites ([Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs))
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development ([Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com))
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript for safer, scalable code
- **Radix UI, Lucide, Framer Motion, SWR, Zod, Zustand**: Powerful component libraries and utilities for forms, icons, animation, state management, and schema validation
- **Vercel Analytics & Speed Insights**: Performance monitoring and analytics
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated deployment to GitHub Pages (see `.github/workflows/`)

See [`package.json`](https://github.com/felskeM/shpe-uwm/blob/main/package.json) for the full list of dependencies.

## 📦 Deployment

- The site is deployed as a static export to [GitHub Pages](https://felskem.github.io/shpe-uwm/).
- Static export means some dynamic features (like image optimization) may not work as expected.
- See the [GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/felskeM/shpe-uwm/tree/main/.github/workflows) for deployment details.

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development

To run the site locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ✨ Design Highlights

- Accessible, responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS
- Modern, minimal style guide (see `/style-guide`)
- Focus on real text, contrast, and UX polish
