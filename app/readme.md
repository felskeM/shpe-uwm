Awesome—looked over your repo structure and it’s a clean Next.js app with Tailwind. Here’s how I’d glow it up, specifically taking advantage of Tailwind v4 and modern Next.js patterns.

# High‑impact visual upgrades

1. Establish a SHPE‑flavored design system (via Tailwind v4 tokens)
   Define your type scale, brand colors (royal blue, gold accents, slate neutrals), spacing, radii, and shadows in one place. In v4 you can declare tokens right in CSS with `@theme`, which makes them first‑class CSS variables and super easy to theme or tweak later. ([Tailwind CSS][1], [MojoAuth][2])
   Example:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@theme {
  --font-sans: "Geist", system-ui, sans-serif;
  --color-brand: #1e3a8a;     /* SHPE blue */
  --color-accent: #f59e0b;    /* gold */
  --radius-card: 1.25rem;
  --shadow-card: 0 10px 25px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.08);
}
```

2. Modern hero + above‑the‑fold
   Use a bold hero with a soft gradient wash, subtle noise texture, and a clear CTA (Join, Events, Sponsor). Tailwind v4 adds expanded gradient utilities—including angled linear gradients—so you can do this without custom CSS. ([Tailwind CSS][3])
   Tips: large display headline, short supporting line, 2 CTAs, and a sponsor “as seen on” strip underneath.

3. Card‑driven layout for content
   Wrap “Upcoming Events”, “Officers”, “Chapters/Initiatives”, and “Sponsors” into consistent cards: rounded‑2xl, generous padding, soft shadow, and a hover lift (`hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-lg transition`). Keep 3‑ or 4‑column grids that collapse cleanly.

4. Motion, but tasteful
   Use Framer Motion for micro‑interactions: fade/slide in hero content, subtle scale on officer cards, staggered reveals on the events grid. Keep durations short (150–250ms) and easings smooth.

5. Typography polish
   Adopt Geist (already in the template) for UI and add a contrasting display font (only for H1/H2) if you want extra personality. Increase line-height, tighten letter‑spacing on headlines, and use 14–15px for small supporting text for hierarchy clarity.

6. Iconography
   Use Lucide for consistent, sharp icons (e.g., for links, socials, locations, majors). Icons + label improve scannability.

# Components to add or refine

* **Navbar:** sticky, translucent background (`backdrop-blur`) after scroll, active link underline animation.
* **Hero:** split layout—left text/CTAs, right a collage of event photos inside masked shapes (Tailwind v4.1 adds masks + text‑shadow utilities to play with headings). ([Tailwind CSS][4])
* **Events section:** timeline/list with date pills and badges (On‑campus, Industry, Workshop).
* **Officer grid:** uniform headshots, title, major, LinkedIn—hover reveals quick actions.
* **Sponsors section:** see dedicated notes below.
* **Footer:** 3 columns (About, Quick Links, Social), small SHPE statement, and contact.

# Tailwind v4‑specific wins to use

* **CSS‑first config & tokens** with `@theme` for colors/spacing/type; easier dark mode theming. ([Tailwind CSS][1], [MojoAuth][2])
* **Expanded gradients** (angles like `bg-linear-45`, `from-* via-* to-*`) for hero and section dividers. ([Tailwind CSS][3])
* **Text‑shadow & masks** (v4.1) for tasteful headings and image treatments—great for sponsor logo knockouts. ([Tailwind CSS][4])
* **Container queries** to fine‑tune grids/cards without gnarly breakpoints. ([MojoAuth][2])
* **Faster builds + smaller CSS** out of the box—lean into utilities, avoid custom CSS when possible. ([Tailkit][5])

# Next.js refinements that boost perceived quality

* Use `next/image` with `placeholder="blur"` and well‑cropped images for officers/events; it dramatically improves polish. ([JavaScript in Plain English][6])
* Segment the homepage into server components for static sections; lazy‑load heavier client bits (galleries, carousels). ([Serviots][7])
* Add metadata (OpenGraph, Twitter) for clean link previews to events and sponsor pages.

# Make the Sponsors page shine (quick win)

Goal: make sponsors feel celebrated and make it easy to add more.

* **Tiered grid with visual hierarchy:**
  Platinum (big cards, full‑color logos), Gold (medium), Silver/Bronze (smaller, mono). Use `aspect-[3/2]` cards with center‑fit logos, neutral card bg, and hover glow.
* **Auto‑fit responsive grid:** `grid grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fit,minmax(160px,1fr))] gap-6` so it looks great at any width.
* **Monochrome on dark, color on hover:** use CSS `filter` utilities or provide mono SVGs; v4’s masks can create stylish, consistent logo crops. ([Tailwind CSS][4])
* **Sponsor CTA bar:** “Become a sponsor” with a small benefit list + PDF deck link.
* **Optional carousel for top tier:** lazy‑loaded only on desktop.

# Accessibility & UX polish (small changes, big feel)

* Increase contrast on buttons (blue background, white text, gold focus ring).
* Focus states on all interactive elements (use `focus-visible:ring-2 ring-offset-2`).
* Prefer real text over text-in-images for headings.
* Generous whitespace—breathe between sections (`py-20 lg:py-28`).

# A minimal style guide page (worth 1–2 hours)

Create `/style-guide` showing typography hierarchy, buttons, forms, card variants, and brand colors (pulled from `@theme`). It keeps future pages consistent and speeds onboarding.

# Suggested class snippets

**Section shell**

```jsx
<section className="relative py-20 lg:py-28">
  <div className="container mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4">
    {/* content */}
  </div>
</section>
```

**Card**

```jsx
<div className="rounded-[var(--radius-card)] shadow-[var(--shadow-card)] bg-white/80 dark:bg-neutral-900/70 border border-black/5 backdrop-blur p-6">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

**Hero gradient**

```jsx
<div className="bg-linear-45 from-[color-mix(in_oklab,var(--color-brand),white_20%)]
                 to-transparent">
  {/* hero */}
</div>
```

(Uses v4’s gradient angles and `color-mix()` nicely.) ([Tailwind CSS][3], [MojoAuth][2])

If you want, I can mock up a new Sponsors page or a polished homepage section with these patterns and drop in a ready‑to‑paste component.
